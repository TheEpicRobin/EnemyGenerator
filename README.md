# EnemyGenerator
A simple AI powered script for generating stat sheets and tokens for TTRPG's

To use this script a few things are required in its current state.
Make sure you have the following in the same folder as the script.

1. A folder named "Enemies" - this is where the script will create the final output
2. A folder named "Images" - This is where the raw image files are stored, should they have use elsewhere
3. A .json file named "API_Keys" Which contains "AI_API_KEY": [Your OpenAI API key here]
4. A PNG file named "Border256" of size 256x256 - This will be a token border overlayed on the created images. The border visuals are up to the user to decide themselves.
